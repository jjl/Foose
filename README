Foose is a project to bring functional programming niceties to Perl

AIMS

We aim to produce these functional niceties on two levels, one a perl library and secondly some Devel::Declare-ish magic to provide pleasing syntax.

PERL AIMS
1. Lazy lists library for Perl
2. Proper, functional map and grep replacements
3. Monad library with continuations support
4. Currying and composition support
5. More haskell-ish and lisp-ish functions that fit in with the above (in the vein of Language::Functional)
6. Compile-time type checking in as far as is possible (matching up the user-defined types, I suspect)
7. Some way of developing a synergy between Moose and functional programming.

DEVEL::DECLARE AIMS
1. Pleasing syntax for all of the above
2. Interoperability with Moose
3. Synergy between Moose and Foose
